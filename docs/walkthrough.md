# Walkthrough

In the following, we're going to show you how to use `kubicorn` to ramp up a Kubernetes cluster in AWS, use it and tear it down again.

As a prerequisite, you need to have `kubicorn` installed. Since we don't have binary releases yet, we assume you've got Go installed and simply do:

```
$ go get github.com/kris-nova/kubicorn
```

If you're new to Go, before you proceed you've to set GOPATH and build the kubicorn binary from source. For this you'd need to build go-bindata and provide it in your path: 

Set GOPATH in your bash profile:

```
$ vi .bash_profil
export GOPATH=/Users/<your user>/go
export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH
```

```
$ go get github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata/go-bindata
$ go build
$ cp go-bindata /usr/local/bin/
```
And run make from the src directory of kubicorn:

```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/kris-nova/kubicorn/
$ make
```
The kubicorn binary will get built and placed under $GOPATH/bin, run kubicorn -h to get the nice Unicorn:

```
$ kubicorn -h
```

The next thing you will do now is to define the cluster resources. For this, you need to select a certain profile. Of course, once you're more familiar with `kubicorn`, you can go ahead and extend existing profiles or create new ones.
In the following we'll be using an existing profile called `aws`, which is—surprise, surprise—a profile for a cluster in AWS.

Now execute the following command:

```
$ kubicorn create --name myfirstk8s --profile aws

2017-07-17T16:42:00+02:00 [✿]  ./_state/myfirstk8s/cluster.yaml has been created. Now run `kubicorn apply myfirstk8s`
```

Note that `kubicorn` executes silently as long as there are no errors but you can always use the `--verbose` flag to increase the information output, for example `kubicorn create --verbose 4` gives you detailed info on what it is doing at any step.

Verify that `kubicorn create` did a good job by executing:

```
$ cat _state/myfirstk8s/cluster.yaml
```

We're now in a position to have the cluster resources defined, locally, based on the selected profile. Next we will apply the so defined resources using the `apply` command, but before we do that we'll set up the access to AWS. You might want to create a new [IAM user](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) for this with the following permissions:

![AWS IAM permissions required for kubicorn](img/aws-iam-user-perm-screen-shot.png)

Next, export the two environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` so that `kubicorn` can pick it up in the next step:

```
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=***************
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=*****************************************
```

Also, make sure that the public SSH key for your AWS account is called `id_rsa.pub`, which is the default in above profile:

```
$ ls -al ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
-rw-------@ 1 mhausenblas  staff   754B 20 Mar 04:03 /Users/mhausenblas/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

With the access set up, we can now apply the resources we defined in the first step. This actually creates resources in AWS. Up to now we've only been working locally.

So, execute:

```
$ kubicorn apply --name myfirstk8s
```

This command again will execute silently. In order to verify if it has been working correctly, go to your AWS console,
select the `us-west-2` region (default in the profile we used) and you should see something like the following:

![AWS EC2 post-creation](img/aws-ec2-post-create-screen-shot.png)

Wait a few minutes until the dust has settled, note the IP of the node (in our case) `myfirstk8s.amazon-master`
and use this to ssh into the master node where the Kubernetes control plane lives:

```
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ubuntu@52.39.36.164
ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-216:~$ sudo docker ps

```

With above command we've verified that indeed `kubicorn` has launched the control plane and we're good to go.

You can now use your freshly baked Kubernetes cluster and once you're done, you can free the resources using following command:

```
$ kubicorn delete --name myfirstk8s
```

Congratulations, you're an official `kubicorn` user now and might want to dive deeper,
for example, learning how to define your own [profiles](https://github.com/kris-nova/kubicorn/tree/master/profiles).
